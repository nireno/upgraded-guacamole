# ancestor event bubbling

~~ Some event handler props are passed to child components for the sole purpose 
of bubbling information back to the parent. Perhaps a naming convention should
be used for such events, eg: callback. ~~

*All* event handler props are meant to have an effect on the parent context.
Event handlers are typically prefixed with "on" so stick with that convention.
